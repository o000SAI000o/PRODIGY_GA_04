# Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that merges the content of one image with the style of another image. This repository provides an implementation of NST using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

Neural Style Transfer involves:

- **Content Image**: The image whose content you want to transfer.
- **Style Image**: The image whose artistic style you want to apply.
- **Generated Image**: The output image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Neural Style Transfer**

   Modify `style_transfer.py` or use as a standalone script to specify:
   - Paths to your content and style images.
   - Adjust weights for content and style.
   - Fine-tune other parameters as needed.

4. **Example Command**

   ```bash
   python style_transfer.py --content content_image.jpg --style style_image.jpg
   ```
